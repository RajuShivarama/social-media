### Facial Image Recognition App

This Project uses Clarifai API to detect face in an image. It helps to detect face in a picture provided by user through URL of image. User's rank gets upgraded everytime user detects image in a picture.

#### Project Requirements
- User should be able to register
- User should be able to signin and signout 
- After succesfull registration or signin, the user should be able to enter the URL of image, click on a detect button and faces detected with a square box
- User's rank gets upgraded everytime user detects image in a picture.


#### Project Approach

- For this full-stack web application, I created the front end components and UI using React, JavaScript, CSS & HTML. This involved creating the signin, register and the home components screens. 

- The next part was creating the backend of this project using node.js and ensuring that the GET, POST and PUT requests would properly function handling the API calls, as well as handling the data. Later on, the data would be connected to a database.

- The last part of the web app was to build a relational database using PostgreSQL to retrieve, store and update each user's data. All these aspects were connected together and tested to ensure each part works.
