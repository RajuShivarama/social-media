#### Project Approach

- For this full-stack web application, I created the front end components and UI using React. This involved creating the signin, register, navigation, header, main and footer components. 

- The next part was creating the backend of this project using Express js and involves creating an admin screen, registering the product's detail in the mongodb database and later the data is sent to the member screen.


#### Technologies Used:
